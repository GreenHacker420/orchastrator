Problem Statement: The "Omni-Retail" Multi-Agent Orchestrator
1. Background
OmniLife is a comprehensive e-commerce conglomerate that manages the entire lifecycle of a customer's shopping experience through four distinct, interdependent software products. Currently, customer support is siloed; agents from one department (e.g., Logistics) cannot see data from another (e.g., Payments).
OmniLife wants to unify this experience using Generative AI. The goal is to build a "Super Agent" that can interface with four specialized "Sub-Agents," each guarding a specific product database, to answer complex, multi-domain customer queries in real-time.
2. The Challenge
Design and implement a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System consisting of one Orchestrator (Super Agent) and four Specialized Agents.
The Super Agent acts as the customer interface. It must parse natural language queries, decompose them into sub-tasks, delegate those tasks to the appropriate Sub-Agents, and synthesize the results into a coherent answer.
The Sub-Agents are responsible for generating and executing SQL queries against their specific relational databases to retrieve raw data.
3. The Data Ecosystem (4 Interdependent Products)
You must generate synthetic data for the following four products. Each product has its own isolated relational database with a minimum of 3 tables.
Product A: "ShopCore" (E-commerce Platform)
Focus: User accounts, product catalog, and initial order placement.
Database: DB_ShopCore
Tables:
Users (UserID, Name, Email, PremiumStatus)
Products (ProductID, Name, Category, Price)
Orders (OrderID, UserID, ProductID, OrderDate, Status)
Product B: "ShipStream" (Logistics & Delivery)
Focus: Physical movement of goods, warehouses, and tracking.
Database: DB_ShipStream
Tables:
Shipments (ShipmentID, OrderID, TrackingNumber, EstimatedArrival)
Warehouses (WarehouseID, Location, ManagerName)
TrackingEvents (EventID, ShipmentID, WarehouseID, Timestamp, StatusUpdate)
Dependency: Links to ShopCore via OrderID.
Product C: "PayGuard" (FinTech & Transactions)
Focus: Wallet management, payment processing, and refunds.
Database: DB_PayGuard
Tables:
Wallets (WalletID, UserID, Balance, Currency)
Transactions (TransactionID, WalletID, OrderID, Amount, Type [Debit/Refund])
PaymentMethods (MethodID, WalletID, Provider, ExpiryDate)
Dependency: Links to ShopCore via UserID and OrderID.
Product D: "CareDesk" (Customer Support)
Focus: Tickets, disputes, and customer satisfaction tracking.
Database: DB_CareDesk
Tables:
Tickets (TicketID, UserID, ReferenceID [can be OrderID or TransID], IssueType)
TicketMessages (MessageID, TicketID, Sender [User/Agent], Content)
SatisfactionSurveys (SurveyID, TicketID, Rating, Comments)
Dependency: Links to all other DBs via ReferenceID and UserID.

4. Functional Requirements
A. The Super Agent (Orchestrator)
Must maintain conversation context.
Must identify which Sub-Agents are needed for a query.
Crucial: Must handle dependencies. (e.g., To check a refund status in PayGuard, the agent might first need to find the OrderID from ShopCore based on a product name provided by the user.)
B. The Sub-Agents
Each Sub-Agent is a "text-to-SQL" expert for its specific schema.
They must return data in a structured format (JSON) that the Super Agent can parse.
They cannot access databases other than their own.
C. Required "Complex Query" Capabilities
The system must successfully resolve queries that require at least 3 out of 4 databases to cooperate.
Example Scenario:
Customer: "I ordered a 'Gaming Monitor' last week, but it hasn't arrived. I opened a ticket about this yesterday. Can you tell me where the package is right now and if my ticket has been assigned to an agent?"
Required Workflow:
ShopCore Agent: Finds the OrderID for the 'Gaming Monitor' ordered by this user.
ShipStream Agent: Uses that OrderID to find the TrackingEvents and current location.
CareDesk Agent: Uses the UserID (or OrderID) to find the recent Ticket status.
Super Agent: Combines these three data points into a helpful response.

5. Deliverables
Database Schemas: SQL scripts to create the 4 databases with sample dummy data.
Agent Logic: Python/Node.js code implementing the Super Agent and 4 Sub-Agents 
Demonstration: A log of 3 distinct customer queries showing the "thought process" of the Super Agent as it coordinates the Sub-Agents.


Feel free to use any multiagent orchestration framework you want. Examples langgraph, google ADK, crew ai, autogen.
